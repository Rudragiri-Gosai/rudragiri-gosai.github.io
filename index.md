## Installation

To install the Flows Auth library, run the following command:

```

Make sure to include the library in your Svelte project to start using its features.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement Flows Auth in your Svelte application.

### Setting Up

First, import the library into your Svelte component:

```javascript
import { Auth } from 'flows-auth';
```

### Initializing Authentication

You can initialize the authentication process as follows:

```javascript
const auth = new Auth({
    // Your configuration options
    clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    redirectUri: 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI',
});
```

### Logging In

To log in a user, call the `login` method:

```javascript
auth.login()
    .then(response => {
        console.log('Login successful:', response);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Login failed:', error);
    });
```

### Logging Out

Logging out is just as straightforward:

```javascript
auth.logout()
    .then(() => {
        console.log('Logout successful');
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Logout failed:', error);
    });
```

### Handling WebAuthn

For WebAuthn, you can utilize the built-in methods to manage user credentials:

```javascript
auth.registerWebAuthn()
    .then(credential => {
        console.log('WebAuthn registration successful:', credential);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('WebAuthn registration failed:', error);
    });
```
